            <h2>Form Objects</h2>
            <p>Forms have a few special characteristics when compared to other elements.
                I will outline them here, and show you how you can make use of them. We
                will refer to the markup below for the entirety of this article, it is
                simple, yet sufficient for what we will be doing..
            </p>
            <pre class="code-demo syntax-highlighted html">
&lt;form id="my-form" action="/nowhere"&gt;

    &lt;label for="my-form__name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="my-form__name" type="text" name="myForm[name]"&gt;

    &lt;label for="my-form__email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="my-form__email" type="text" name="myForm[email]"&gt;

    &lt;button id="my-form__submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
            <h3><em>1.</em> Forms are Iterable</h3>
            <p>
                Normally, to access an elements children, you would need to use
                <code>element.children[i]</code>. Forms, however, allow you to
                directly access their child elements without needing to type
                <code>.children</code>. Furthermore, using this method will ignore
                any elements that aren't interactable within the form. With regard
                to the markup above, <code>form[0]</code> would reference the
                name input, while <code>form[2]</code> would reference
                the submit button.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even more convenient, if our interactable form elements have been
                asigned <code>id</code>'s, like in the markup above, we can simply
                use the <code>id</code> like so, <code>form.buttonId</code>. 
                This is particularly useful, as if we wish to add a new field to our
                form, we don't have to worry about messing up our indexing.
                The
                markup above has a complex <code>id</code> naming structure (for
                reasons that will become clear later), so we would have to use
                bracket notation in this case, <code>form['my-form__name']</code>.
            </p>

            <h3><em>2.</em> Forms are Pre-Cached</h3>
            <p>
                We are mostly taught to cache our form like this:
            </p>
            <p><code>const myForm = document.querySelector('form');</code></p>
            <p>
                But forms are so widely used in web development, that forms are
                in fact pre-cached onto the <code>document</code> object. The
                <code>document.forms</code> object returns an array of all the
                forms on a given page. Like the form objects we've already spoken
                about, they are iterable! So, to access our form, that is the only
                one on it's page, we'd simply need to reference
                <code>document.forms[0]</code>. Or better yet, use it's <code>id</code>,
                <code>document.forms['my-form']</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>Making Use of these Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
                Working with a lot of forms holding varied data can be taxing when
                you are still new to coding (I speak from experience!).
                But, by leveraging these characteristics of forms, we can make our work
                a lot easier. Let's take a look at the following javascript, and break
                down how it would interact with the form markup we are using.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-demo syntax-highlighted js">
const form = {
    id: 'my-form',
    init: () => {
        form.form = document.forms[form.id];
        form.submitButton = form.form[`${form.id}__submit`];
    },
    validate: () => {
        for (let elem of form.form) {
            if (elem !== form.submitButton && !elem.value) {
                console.log('VALIDATION ERROR!');
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};

form.init();

form.submitButton.addEventListener('click', (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    if (form.validate()) form.form.submit();
});</pre>
            <p>If you are still learning JavaScript, this could look deceptively 
                complicated, but it's not. Let's break it down...
            </p>
            <p>
                First we have created a "form" <code>object</code>, for now let's
                just concern ourselves with <code>form.id</code> and
                <code>form.init</code>. <code>form.id</code> is simple, it's just
                a string that matches the form's <code>id</code> in the markup. The
                <code>form.init</code> method simply adds the <code>form</code> and
                <code>submitButton</code> properties to the object - we need to
                access the <code>form.id</code> property in order to do this, which
                isn't accessable until after the form <code>object</code> is
                created, therefore they are added after the fact when 
                <code>form.init()</code> is called.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, let's look at the event listener. It is attached to the
                <code>form.submitButton</code>. We are using 
                <code>event.preventDefault()</code> to gain a little control over
                what the submit button should do. We will only call the form's
                <code>submit</code> method if our <code>validate</code> method,
                defined in the form <code>object</code>, returns <code>true</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>form.validate</code> method is checking that none
                of the input fields are left blank, you could write seperate
                validation rules depending on the input types, or anything else
                you might need to check before a form submission. The 
                <code>validate</code> method iterates through the form elements -
                don't forget the <code>button</code> element is included here, so 
                in our if
                statement we first check that the current <code>elem</code> is not
                the form's
                <code>submitButton</code>, if that condition is passed then the
                element we are currently iterating over must be an input. We then
                check for the absence <code>!</code> of a <code>value</code> on the 
                input, if there is not value present, then the input has been left 
                blank,
                and we use <code>return false</code> to break out of the method.
                Otherwise, the method returns <code>true</code> after the loop,
                and the <code>form.submit</code> method is executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the benefit of tidy code, it may not be necessary to
                move the form into an object, however I have used this to demonstrate
                he concept, because where there is an object, there 
                can be a class to create many objects. Using template strings and 
                an id naming structure
                like in the above example, 
                will also make code more reusable
                throughout a project. Take a look at a simpler
                implementation below.
            </p>
            <pre class="code-demo syntax-highlighted js">
const formId = 'my-form';
const form = document.forms[formId];

const validate = (form) => {
    for (let elem of form) {
        if (elem !== form[`${formId}__submit`] && !elem.value) {
            console.log('VALIDATION ERROR!');
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

form[`${formId}__submit`].addEventListener('click', (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    if (validate(form)) form.submit();
});</pre>

        <article id="typing-animations">
            <h2>Typing Animations</h2>
            <p>A good rule to follow is: if it can be done in CSS, then you shouldn't do it in JavaScript.
                JavaScript is far more taxing on the browser when it comes to animations than CSS. Even so,
                sometimes CSS just doesn't give the desired effect. I recently wanted to create a typing animation,
                and while the CSS solutions I found were <em>somewhat</em> effective, they weren't entirely
                convincing, and also fell apart on blocks of text spanning more than one line. For a character
                by character typing effect, I turned to JavaScript and it's yummy recursion.
            </p>

            <pre class="code-demo syntax-highlighted js">
let typeInterval;

const typeText = (text, element) => {
    if (text.length > 0) {
        element.innerText += text[0];

        typeInterval = setTimeout(function () {
            typeText(text.substring(1, text.length), element);
        }, 60);  
    }

    else return;
}           </pre>

            <p>The <code>typeText</code> function above takes two params, <code>text</code>, and an
                <code>element</code>. The breakout condition simply requires the length of text to be
                zero, in which case it's job is done. If the text length is greater than zero, the function
                will simply add whatever character sits at index zero within the string to the elements
                <code>innerText</code>, and then uses
                <code>setTimeout</code> to call itself again, with the same element, and the same string,
                except this time missing the 0th character. I have used substring in this example but you
                can also use the slice method. I have set the timeout to 60ms as that's what I felt seemed
                convincing, although if you wanted to you could use a randomised number to make it even more
                realistic. Finally, the <code>setTimeout</code> is assigned to a variable outside of the functions
                scope, this is not enitrely necessary, but is handy if you want a way to cancel the animation
                part-way through, i.e. to trigger a different typing animation on the same element (don't forget that
                the <code>setTimeout</code> is just going to go off and do it's thing unless you call a
                <code>clearTimeout</code> to cancel it!). Hover on the git actions below to see the end result.
